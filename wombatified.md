# Sample visual essay

This was a sample visual essay demonstrating a few key features of a Visual Essay.  And then I broke it.

## Behold the Beast

Two things about wombats.  One, never attack one from the front.  They are ferocious and have big teeth and sharp claws.  Two, never attack one from behind, because they have a thick armor plate covering the rear of their anatomy.  Up until about a year old, wombats are gentle creatures that can be safely petted and handled.  After that they become mindless killing machines.  I learned this while holding a wombat at an Australian bush park.  "How old is this one?" I wondered.  "We're not sure," said the ranger.  "Maybe about 11 months."  Australians have an odd sense of humor and don't really like Americans.

## Where on Earth
Wombats generally come from Tasmania, which is an odd triangular piece of the Australian continent that seems to have broken off.  Our planet should be more careful with its land masses.
